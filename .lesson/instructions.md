# Learning Markdown
This is a markdown file. You have probably seen these before on your other Replit projects, but **what is a markdown file?**  

Well here is what Wikipedia has to say about markdown:

>"Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. John Gruber and Aaron Swartz created Markdown in 2004 as a markup language that is appealing to human readers in its source code form. Markdown is widely used in blogging, instant messaging, online forums, collaborative software, documentation pages, and readme files."  
 -Wikipedia Article on Markdown  

### Why is markdown important to you?

Almost all software developers across the world use markdown in some way, shape or form. If you continue into the world of computer science, you see markdown in many places. Many developers use markdown as a way to formart their documentation or their readme files. *You will need to use markdown to complete your write ups for both practice performance tasks in Mr. Kramlich's class.*
